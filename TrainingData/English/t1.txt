One of the Boys is an American sitcom created by Blake Hunter and Martin Cohan that aired six episodes on NBC from April 15 to May 20, 1989. It was one of only a few United States prime time programs of the 1980s to star a Latin American woman—María Conchita Alonso. She features as Maria Conchita Navarro, a Venezuelan immigrant to the United States who begins working in the office of a small construction company and marries its widowed owner, Mike Lukowski (Robert Clohessy). Five production companies oversaw filming at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, where delays prevented critics from watching a preview in advance of the premiere. Critical reviews were poor to middling. The mid-season replacement received inconsistent Nielsen ratings and was not renewed for a second season by NBC.

The sitcom One of the Boys follows Maria Conchita Navarro (María Conchita Alonso), a Venezuelan immigrant to the United States pursuing the American Dream by leaving her job as a waitress and becoming a bookkeeper at the Lukowski Construction Company in the New York City borough of Queens.[1] The actress and character are similar in name, personality, and country of origin.[2] David Walstad of The Philadelphia Inquirer described Navarro as Alonso's alter ego, The Miami Herald's Juan Carlos Coto deemed her autobiographical,[3] and Alonso said "the character is just like" her.[4] In contrast to the stereotypical portrayal of Latin Americans as poor and uneducated, Navarro is a clever woman with class who speaks English.[2] She is from a well-off family but wants to achieve her goals without their assistance,[5] which is exemplified in her opinionated nature and motorcycle riding.[6] According to Alonso, Navarro is a "full of life, tomboyish, yet feminine" woman.[7] Amy Aquino plays her best friend Bernice DeSalvo,[a] a waitress the actress considered a wisecracker who "has trouble getting dates".[8]

Navarro's love interest is Mike Lukowski (Robert Clohessy), the small business owner of the Lukowski Construction Company and recently widowed father of three boys:[9] 20-year-old Luke Lukowski (Michael DeLuise), 18-year-old Steve Lukowski (Billy Morrissette), and 13-year-old Nick Lukowski (Justin Whalin).[1] Luke works on the company's job sites with foreman Ernie (Dan Hedaya) while Steve and Nick attend school.[10] Mike and Maria's relationship quickly becomes romantic and they wed in the fifth episode.[6]
